# What is Studious?
Made by introverts, for introverts (everyone, really), Studious aims to help connect university students to each other for study sessions in a discreet manner.

# To-Do List

* Build out "New Sesh" functionality
   * Build New Sesh interface
   * Figure out how to store the data with Google Data Store
   * Will be anonymous-ish at first -- add user profiles/account stuff later

* Homepage
    * Make search & new sesh button look better
    * Dynamic updates to latest sesh requests shown on homepage

* Map
    * Drop pins for latest sesh updates on homepage -- maximum of 5 pins
    * Draw boundary around nearest campus (?)
    * Get rid of 'location found message'
